                            Hulkamaniacs!! The #1 seed Dead Birds make their first championship appearance as the heavy favorites.
                            Ezekiel Elliott returns to a team that started 4-0 and won 7 of their first 8.
                            Dead Birds were 2nd in scoring this season and if they go wire-to-wire will become the 4th straight 1-seed to win it all!

                            Oooh Yeah!!! Roids, perhaps the hottest team in the league with 5 straight wins, including playoff wins
                            vs the 2-seed & the league's highest scoring team. A strong end to the season was ignited by trades for Antonio Brown & Le'Veon Bell.
                            Now with Brown out (and Zeke back) does this <em>Macho Man</em> have enough to get that 1st championship that has eluded them twice before?

                                      <strong>KFC 108 - MDHB 82</strong><br />
                                      It was only 5 minutes in when Jordy Nelson scored his 1st TD. By 2p Xmas Eve
                                      his 2nd signaled a hot start for KFC. It ended with a swift blow from League
                                      MVP David Johnson and his 3 Christmas Eve TDs!! What a comeback year for
                                      KFC Karaokee & Jordy Nelson — last year KFC's 4-win season produced a
                                      trade for the keeper rights to Jordy Nelson (on IR) from My Ditka Her Butkus for
                                      Adrian Peterson. A pivotal moment for MDHB as well... AP led to a 1st-round
                                      playoff loss last year ... and although they scraped their way to the
                                      Championship this season, the one that got away — Jordy Nelson — showed
                                      he's a Championship WR.

                                      After 5 straight seasons in the playoffs, winning scoring titles and top seeds, the
                                      Slick Nicks finally ended the season with that sweet, sweet Championship
                                      champagne! Extra "slick" performances by QB Kirk Cousins & the unlikely
                                      supporting cast of Allen Robinson, Latavius Murray, & Brandin Cooks helped
                                      clinched the Trophy in a 111-74 win over the Baby Centipedes. With the loss,
                                      QB Cam Newton ends his run of 3 straight championships and the Centipedes
                                      come up just shy in their long awaited first playoffs.

                                <p>
                                  After a season-long battle for the league's top spot Team BEER returned to the
                                  throne with a 93–82 big gulp over Favre Dollars. MVP Ryan Tannehill played his
                                  best game of the season leading BEER with 30 points. This victory avenged 1 of
                                  just 3 losses on the season for BEER by defeating Favre Dollars. Both team
                                  started the season hot at 5-0 but it's Team BEER who is now 5-0 all-time in the
                                  playoffs as they secured their 2nd TFC League Championship!

                                  Von Bologna Hates Emo City slices up the Slick Nicks 120-104 to win the
                                  Championship! Bologna finishes at a climax with an average score 25
                                  points/game higher in the post-season. They ran into a red-hot Slick Nick team
                                  averaging 145/game in the playoffs but Romo, Moreno & Chiefs DST didn't play
                                  up to snuff. In the end it was Nick Foles leading Bologna to the prize on Sunday
                                  Night after strong performances by DeMarco Murray, Joique Bell & Seahawks
                                  DST. Bologna's made it back to the Championship game 3 years after their first
                                  trip following 2 Loser Bowls but it's all worth it now as they hoist that perky
                                  prize!

                                      Sky Clouds defeat GAMETIME 102-81 to win the league championship. RG3's
                                      team-high 15 wasn't enough for GAMETIME as they lose their 2nd straight title
                                      game. Another Holiday, another Sky Clouds-GAMETIME matchup. Cam Newton
                                      & the Sky Clouds got the best of RG3 & GAMETIME during a Thanksgiving
                                      matchup. They met again Christmas weekend for the Championship. Both
                                      players scored more than 30 in their first matchup. It was all Sky Clouds the
                                      second time around as Cam Newton got some help from Eric Decker, CJ Spiller
                                      & the Rams D/ST to win the Championship.

                                  over Megatron & The Cupcakes. Even Tebow Time couldn't save the Cupcakes
                                  with Stafford and Spiller on the bench for the big game. Flaco Punch celebrate
                                  with their first Iron Football Championship.

                                  It was a lot closer than expected as Team BEER won 75-67 to clinch the
                                  Championship Tuesday night. It came down to the final minutes as Michael Vick
                                  scored 20 points to Jeremy Maclin's 7 for Emo City. Vick rushed in for a 10-yd
                                  TD score with 10:17 remaining in the game to secure the Championship for
                                  Team BEER.
